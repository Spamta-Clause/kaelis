# The Surface
*The Surface* is sparsely populated, only a few groups nomadic tribes that scavenge for scraps among the remnants of [[Signalspire]], the capital city of [[Kaelis/Locations/Kaelis Minor|Kaelis Minor]]. [[Signalspire]] is massive, taking days to navigate even without hiding from the [[Solphages]]. The huge robots that once defended the city now stalk the clans, thousands throughout the entire city, with many different versions, although nearly all are deadly. 
# Surface Dwellers
The slow do not survive, the weak do not survive, the injured do not survive. The *Surface Dwellers* lack the typical weaponry found in [[Kaelis/Locations/Subhaven|Subhaven]], instead fueled by stellar radiation they travel through the shadows of the great atmoscrapers.
