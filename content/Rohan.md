# The Divine
Known by either *The Deities* or *The Divine*. 

*The Divine* are not the origin of the humanoids, instead, *The Divine* were created by humanoids of another planet to foretell the future and spread the human race, it is unknown if the original society still lives. *The Divine* are rarely thought of as separate individuals, and are only thought of as a collective. 

The [[Solphages]] were members of *The Divine* prior to their split, most of the [[Solphages]] were weaker angelic beings. They split due to believing that the humanoids were undeserving of the effort being used to maintain. Split from the great power source of *The Divine*, they sought a new source in the form of stellar radiation. *The Divine* and [[Solphages]] are emotional creatures, so the [[Solphages]] wanted to destroy the remaining humanoid to cause grief to *The Divine*.
