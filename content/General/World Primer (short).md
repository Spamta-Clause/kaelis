### The Known World
The campaign will begin in the underground city of [[Subhaven]]. [[Subhaven]] is built in ancient transport tunnels. It once connected to a “surface,” but no contact has existed for **700 years**. Most people believe Subhaven is the entire world.

### Societal Issues
Magic is rare, chaotic and feared, in years past people would hunt mages to study their power.

Clanks are disliked and distrusted, records show this has occurred since the founding of [[Subhaven]].
### Governance prior to the Civil War
Subhaven was ruled by **Conductors**, each secretly controlled by an implanted AI:  
**G.O.L.E.M.** (Governance-Oriented Logic Engine & Magistrate). When [[Conductor Warrick]] attempted to pass the implant to [[Ryden the Honest]] it sparked the civil war.

### The Civil War
The [[Civil War]] was a series of brief battles 4 years ago. Few died, leaving many to remember the betrayals.
- **Defense Sector** supported Ryden and rejected AI rule.
- **Farming & Recycling Sectors** supported G.O.L.E.M. for its efficiency in crops and water.
- **Energy Sector** split over whether G.O.L.E.M. consumed too much electricity.
The war was more siege than battlefield — energy, food, and water were withheld or stolen, creating lasting mistrust.

### Governance after the Civil War
Ryden became the first democratic leader, now called the **Beacon**.  
G.O.L.E.M. was deleted and all traces erased.  
Many loyalists to the old system were demoted, though some experts like **Scarlet Korr** of Farming remained out of necessity.

### Resources and Technology
Subhaven relies almost entirely on **recycled materials**. New mining is impossible after the remaining machinery failed generations ago.

[[Tokens]] are the standard currency; they can be exchanged for government rations (“_slop_”) or used to buy better food from farmers.

Technology is a mixture of advanced and decayed:

- Personal electronics are rare and heavily cannibalized.
- Some advanced energy systems, batteries, shields, beam tools still function but are difficult to reproduce.
- Firearms exist but are uncommon; shock-spears and simple weapons are more practical.
- Clanks and drones are relics, seldom used since the civil war.
[[Subhaven]] is advanced in some areas, yet very primitive in others.
