### The Known World
The campaign will begin in the underground city of [[Subhaven]]. [[Subhaven]] was once a large tunnel network used to transport resources to the "surface" of the moon, this was over a thousand years prior, and no contact has been made with the "surface" for 700 years, many if not most question the idea of a "surface", believing it has always only been [[Subhaven]].

### Societal Issues
Magic is uncommon, rarely seen more than a handful of times in a single generation, and often weak. The origin of magic is unknown, and there are those who seek to learn magic themselves, craving for the power it gives. These such people would stop at nothing, many killing and dissecting mages in a search for the origin of their abilities.

There is also a common dislike and distrust of Clanks, although the origin is unknown, this has been documented for the entirety of [[Subhaven]]'s existence.
### Governance prior to the Civil War
Originally, the leaders were known by the title [[Conductor]], and led the autocratic government of Subhaven. Each [[Conductor]] secretly received a neural implant that overtook them, this A.I was known as G.O.L.E.M, or the *Governance-Oriented Logic Engine & Magistrate*. During a transition of power, when the [[Conductor]] selected a new leader, often an assistant or fellow government worker would receive the same chip. [[Conductor Warrick]] attempted to pass leadership to [[Ryden the Honest]], Ryden refused to accept the neural implant sparking the [[Civil War]]. 

### The Civil War
The [[Civil War]] was a short, series of battles beginning 4 years ago, and only lasting a couple of months. Very few died in the war, although many were lightly injured, a loss of life was intolerable for both sides, and most citizens were vital to the continued survival of [[Subhaven]], this means nearly every single soldier, and fighter still lives, and they certainly hold grudges. The [[Defense Sector]] was largely against the continued rule of G.O.L.E.M, [[Ryden the Honest]] was previously a high ranking officer within the [[Defense Sector]], leading many to support him purely on loyalty. The [[Recycling Sector]] and the [[Farming Sector]] were in favor of [[G.O.L.E.M]], as it offered more efficient practices for recycling, and monitoring the soil mineral counts provided sound crop choices. The [[Energy Sector]] was largely split in the matter, many believed that running [[G.O.L.E.M]] required a significant amount of energy and could exhaust their supplies, yet others supported [[G.O.L.E.M]], as it was free from any potential bias, allowing it to make the best choices for the population. 

There was no typical battle front, instead much of the battle could be compared to a siege. With the [[Revolution]] largely in control of the [[Energy Sector]] through the force of the soldiers they could withhold non-essential systems to the others. However, the farmers refused to supply the [[Revolution]] with any food, similar events transpired with the [[Recycling Sector]] refusing water. Many of these anti-revolutionaries were attacked or forced to provide for the [[Revolution]], creating the large distrust seen between the different sides of the [[Revolution]].

### Governance after the Civil War
[[Ryden the Honest]] was proclaimed [[Beacon]] following the [[Civil War]], and in the following [[election]] was elected for his first democratic term. [[G.O.L.E.M]] was shutdown and deleted, and many who fought the [[Revolution]] were demoted, except for [[Scarlet Korr]], leader of the [[Farming Sector]] remained in power due to their knowledge.

### Resources and Technology
Resources are largely recycled, comparable to the Fallout games, where they are scavenged from existing technology, a catastrophic incident destroyed the remaining mining vehicles effectively destroying the ability to gather new materials to forge into technology.

Payment is made through [[Tokens]], a new form of currency created by [[Ryden the Honest]], the Government does have locations where [[Tokens]] can be exchanged for what is affectionally known as *Slop*, a meal created out of waste parts of vegetables and animals. Vegetables and meats are often instead purchased from members of the [[Farming Sector]] who are partially paid in the form of ingredients.

[[Subhaven]] is both ahead, and behind of 21st century technology, phones, and other personal computing devices are rare, their circuitry having gone through generations of repurposing, yet many other technologies such as batteries have been condensed. Far space travel is not believed to be known, only recorded space travel is the supposed terraforming of [[Kaelis Minor]], where [[Subhaven]] resides, [[Kaelis Prime]] is the planet that [[Kaelis Minor]] orbits. Unmanned robots such as drones have been used for surveillance in unsafe areas yet are yet to be seen under the [[Ryden the Honest]].

Guns do exist, although are not favored due to the potential damage they can cause from stray projectiles, the gunpowder used in [[Classical Guns]] is rare, and [[Beam Guns]] are often seen as much too disastrous. Shock spears are a weapon often used by guards and other military forces due to their availability and low cost. Electromagnetic shields that repel attacks are rare and often fragile but are present.
